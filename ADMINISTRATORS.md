# ADMINISTRATORS.md
This document contains instructions for test administrators who want to use this program on their test.

---

Please tell your test takers to:
1. Download the Mouse Logger program [here](https://github.com/EthicallyPython/Mouse-Logger#download).
2. Follow the instructions in the above link.
3. Do the test two times.
    - **Important**: before starting each test, make sure that the Cheating Configurations are set correctly. See image below for reference.
    - 1st time: **no** cheating.
    - 2nd time: cheat using any method. Some examples include:
        -  looking up the answer on the computer
        -  looking up the answer on another device (such as your phone)
        -  giving help to another student
4. Upload all files *inside* the `Mouse Logs` folder to a centralized location (for example, a Learning Management System such as Canvas). DO NOT UPLOAD THE `Mouse Logs` FOLDER ITSELF.

After, the administrator must:
1. Download all submitted data.
2. Combine all data into one folder. If any files conflict, keep both. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiyFR4i2puA) if you are unsure.
3. Send the combined folder to 92.89 [at] pcsb [dot] org

All logs should be separated by test format. For example, assume you have tests named `Test A`, `Test B`, and `Test C`. It is best to create folders for each test. `Test A`'s logs should go in the `Test A` folder. The same goes for `Test B` and `Test C`.
